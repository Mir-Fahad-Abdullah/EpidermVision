## A Skin Disease Detection Project Using Deep Learning

Skin diseases are a significant global health concern, demanding timely and accurate 
diagnosis for effective treatment. Traditional diagnostic methods rely on subjective visual 
inspection, leading to variability and potential misdiagnosis. This proposal introduces a 
novel approach: automated skin disease detection using deep learning. Our project aims 
to develop a deep-learning model capable of accurately identifying skin diseases from 
images. We will train convolutional neural networks (CNNs) models on a diverse dataset 
of skin conditions. Key components include data collection, preprocessing, model 
selection, training, and evaluation. We will gather high-quality images and employ 
techniques like image augmentation and normalization for robustness. State-of-the-art 
CNN architectures such as ResNet, VGG, Inception, DenseNet, etc. will be explored, 
along with transfer learning for efficiency. Rigorous evaluation metrics will ensure model 
performance. Overall, our project promises to enhance diagnostic accuracy in 
dermatology, improving patient outcomes and healthcare delivery.
