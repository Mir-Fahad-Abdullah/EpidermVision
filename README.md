## Project Overview
Skin diseases represent a significant global health concern, affecting millions of 
individuals worldwide and necessitating accurate and timely diagnosis for effective 
management. However, the conventional diagnostic approaches reliant on subjective 
visual assessment by dermatologists often lead to inconsistencies and potential 
misdiagnoses. In response to these challenges, there is a growing interest in leveraging 
cutting-edge technologies, particularly deep learning, to revolutionize the field of 
dermatological diagnosis.

This project introduces an innovative approach to address the shortcomings of 
traditional diagnostic methods by harnessing the power of deep learning for automated 
skin disease detection. By employing advanced convolutional neural networks (CNNs) 
and leveraging diverse datasets, our project aims to develop a robust system capable of 
accurately identifying a wide range of dermatological conditions from images.

Here, we underscore the pressing need for improved diagnostic techniques in 
dermatology, emphasizing the limitations of current practices and the potential of deep 
learning to overcome these challenges. Through this project, we aspire to contribute to 
the advancement of diagnostic accuracy and efficiency in dermatology, ultimately 
enhancing patient care and healthcare delivery.
